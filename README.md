# cc-dev-kit

A personal Claude Code marketplace bundling the agents and skills I reuse across projects. Nothing hardcodes a specific project — the agents learn each repo's conventions at runtime by reading its `CLAUDE.md` and existing code, then work *within* those conventions.

## Plugins

### `dev-workflow` — stack-agnostic

Assumes **no framework**. Works on any codebase.

- `architect` — designs a plan for non-trivial / multi-file changes, doesn't write code.
- `feature-builder` — implements a feature end-to-end, matching the repo's existing patterns.
- `senior-developer` — judgment work: investigations, tuning, refactors, deep answers.
- `code-reviewer` — reviews a diff against the project's own conventions, read-only.
- `feature-flow` (skill) — orchestrates plan → build → review → fix-loop across the agents above.
- `tdd` (skill) — drives a feature test-first (red → green): writes the failing tests, locks them, then loops hands-free until they pass.
- `commit` (skill) — atomic git commits grouped by intent.
- `pr` (skill) — push + open a pull request (GitHub) or merge request (GitLab), platform auto-detected.
- `laravel` (skill) — stack pack: Laravel/PHP patterns (Actions/FormRequests/Jobs, queues & Horizon, Eloquent vs document stores, a correctness checklist). The four agents invoke it on demand when the repo is Laravel — stack specialization lives in a skill, not a duplicate family of agents. Adding another stack is a new skill (`django`, `astro`, …), not new agents.

### `meta-workflow` — Claude Code asset authoring

For building the tooling itself, not application code.

- `agent-skill-reviewer` — reviews a Claude Code subagent / skill definition file (`.claude/agents/<name>.md`, `SKILL.md`): the `description`/trigger contract, internal coherence, declared-vs-used tools, and routing overlap with siblings. Read-only, returns a report.

## Install (any machine)

```

To update later: `/plugin marketplace update cc-dev-kit`.
