# TDD loop — test-first, hands-free to green

Drive a feature with the **red → green** cycle: write the tests **first**, watch them fail, then let
the loop write the implementation until every test passes — **without ever editing the tests**.

This skill is **rails, not the solver.** It does not "implement the feature" in one clever pass. It
sets up the playground (failing tests + a locked target + a stop condition) and hands the actual
problem-solving to **a loop of attempts** that converges on green. If you solved it in one shot you
wouldn't need a loop at all — the iteration *is* the mechanism.

Its scope ends at **green + clean teardown.** Reviewing whether the implementation truly generalises
(rather than overfitting the tests) and committing are **handed back** — this skill points you to the
project's reviewer / `feature-flow` and `commit` skill; it does not re-orchestrate them.

## Core principles — read before acting

- **Integration, not substitution.** Plug into the project's existing workflow; introduce no
  conventions of your own. Discover and reuse: the project's **test runner + test conventions** for
  the red phase, the project's **implementation agents** for the green phase, the project's **commit
  skill** for the handoff. The only thing this skill adds is two *temporary* guardrails (a test-lock
  and an until-green gate), removed at the end.
- **One cheat hard-blocked, one cheat flagged.** (1) *Editing the tests* to make them pass → blocked
  deterministically by a `PreToolUse` hook. (2) *Hard-coding the expected answers* without really
  implementing the feature (overfitting) → the loop **cannot** catch this: green is necessary, not
  sufficient. Don't pretend otherwise — **flag it at handoff** so the user (or a reviewer such as
  `code-reviewer`) verifies the implementation generalises.
- **Hands-free until green — after you've signed off on RED.** Once armed (Step 2), it runs without
  interaction. A `Stop` hook re-runs the tests and refuses to end the turn while they are red. There is a built-in safety valve (Claude Code
  releases the stop after ~8 consecutive blocks), so a genuinely unreachable green stops and reports
  instead of looping forever.
- **The tests are the spec.** A test must fail for the *right* reason (assertion / missing symbol),
  never a syntax error or a wrong test command.
- **Run from the main conversation.** This skill asks one setup question and dispatches subagents —
  both need the top-level thread. Don't run it from inside a subagent.

---

## Step 0 — Discover the stack's existing test workflow

Detect the **test command** from the project, in this order — stop at the first that fits:

- A documented test convention in the repo (e.g. a `tests/`-level doc, or a `## Testing` section in
  `CLAUDE.md`) → read it and use the exact command + any container/invocation it specifies (including
  a `docker exec <container> ./vendor/bin/pest`-style wrapper). Honor its conventions for the red
  tests too.
- `composer.json` (script `test`) / `phpunit.xml` → Pest/PHPUnit.
- `package.json` (script `test`, or vitest/jest dep) → `npm test` / `pnpm test` / `yarn test`.
- `pytest.ini` / `pyproject.toml` / `tox.ini` → `pytest`.
- `go.mod` → `go test ./...`. · `Cargo.toml` → `cargo test`. · `.rspec` / `Gemfile` → `rspec`.
- A `Makefile` with a `test` target → `make test`.

Also note the project's **test file location** (where tests live), which becomes the lock target.

If the command is **ambiguous or undetectable**, ask — this is the only *configuration* question. Use
it to also confirm you may run the suite repeatedly during the loop (this satisfies any "ask before
running the tests" project rule — one confirmation covers the run). The one other pause is the **RED
checkpoint** at the end of Step 1, before the loop is armed:

```
AskUserQuestion → "Which command runs this project's tests?"
  options: <best-guess command>, "Other"  (header: "Test command")
```

State the detected command and the feature you're about to drive, then proceed.

## Step 1 — RED: write the failing tests

From the user's feature description, write tests describing the expected behaviour — concrete
input/output pairs and the edge cases — **following the project's existing test conventions** (the
documented convention / framework style from Step 0). No house style of your own.

Be explicit that this is TDD: **write no implementation, and no stub that fakes a pass.** Then run the
test command and **confirm the tests fail for the right reason** (assertion or missing symbol — not a
syntax error, not a wrong command). Show the red output as evidence.

Record the **exact list of test files you wrote/touched** — this is the **locked set**.

**Checkpoint — validate RED before arming (pause here, wait for the user).** The tests are the spec,
and once Step 2 arms the loop the run goes hands-free — so get explicit sign-off first. Present:

- the **locked set** (the test files), with one line per test on what it asserts;
- the **red output**, as evidence they fail for the right reason (assertion / missing symbol, not a
  syntax error or wrong command).

Ask the user to confirm the tests capture the intended behaviour — or to adjust them. Iterate on the
tests here as needed; **the spec is only frozen once they approve.** Only on confirmation do you move
to Step 2 and arm the guardrails.

## Step 2 — Lock the tests + arm the loop (the guardrails)

Create a small, self-contained guard kit under `.claude/tdd/` and wire two hooks into the project's
`.claude/settings.local.json` (the *local*, gitignored settings — never `settings.json`, we don't
commit guardrails).

**`.claude/tdd/locked-tests.txt`** — one locked test path per line. Use **sufficiently-qualified**
paths (e.g. `tests/Feature/FooTest.php`, not a bare `FooTest.php`) so the suffix match below can't
deny edits to an unrelated same-named file.

**`.claude/tdd/lock-tests.sh`** — deny any edit to a locked test:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
dir="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)"
file="$(jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // empty')"
[ -z "$file" ] && exit 0
while IFS= read -r locked; do
  [ -z "$locked" ] && continue
  if [ "$file" = "$locked" ] || [[ "$file" == *"$locked" ]]; then
    jq -n '{hookSpecificOutput:{hookEventName:"PreToolUse",permissionDecision:"deny",
      permissionDecisionReason:"TDD green phase: the tests are locked. Implement the code to satisfy them; do not modify the tests."}}'
    exit 0
  fi
done < "$dir/locked-tests.txt"
exit 0
```

**`.claude/tdd/check-green.sh`** — re-run the suite; block the stop while red. Substitute the Step 0
command into `TEST_CMD`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
dir="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)"
TEST_CMD='<DETECTED TEST COMMAND FROM STEP 0>'
if eval "$TEST_CMD" >"$dir/green.out" 2>&1; then
  exit 0   # green → allow the stop
fi
jq -n --rawfile out "$dir/green.out" \
  '{decision:"block", reason:("Tests are still red — keep implementing (never edit the locked tests) until they pass.\n\nLatest output:\n" + $out)}'
exit 0
```

`chmod +x` both scripts. Then **merge** (do not overwrite) into `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "bash \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/tdd/lock-tests.sh\"" } ] }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      { "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "bash \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/tdd/check-green.sh\"" } ] }
    ]
  }
}
```

Read the file first and splice these in alongside any existing `hooks`; keep everything else intact.
Remember exactly what you added so the teardown can remove only that.

## Step 3 — GREEN: hand the work to the loop

Now the loop runs the show. The instruction to follow each iteration:

> Write the **minimal** implementation that satisfies the locked tests. Run the tests. Iterate.
> **Never** touch the locked tests.

The `Stop` hook keeps the turn alive until the suite is green; the `PreToolUse` hook makes editing a
test impossible. **This is where the problem gets solved — by the loop, not by this skill.**

**Delegate the implementation to the project's own coding agent** when one exists — always
**discover what's actually available** via the `Agent` tool / `.claude/agents` first. With
`dev-workflow` installed that's `feature-builder` (new code) or `senior-developer` (cases needing
reasoning) — on a Laravel project they pull in the `laravel` skill themselves; in another project it
will be whatever specialist exists there. Fall back to implementing inline only when no specialist
agent fits. The guardrails apply to delegated work too — a subagent's edits go through the
same `PreToolUse` lock, and the `Stop` gate fires when the **main** agent tries to finish, so the loop
runs *through* the delegation (main → delegate → return → run tests → still red? continue/re-delegate).
*If a `PreToolUse` hook turns out not to fire inside a subagent on this Claude Code build, also pass
"do not modify the tests" explicitly in the delegation prompt as a belt-and-suspenders.*

## Step 4 — Teardown + handoff

- **Disarm:** remove the two hooks you added from `.claude/settings.local.json` (leave any pre-existing
  hooks untouched) and delete `.claude/tdd/`. The tests are unlocked again. Do this even if the loop
  ended without reaching green (reported via the safety valve) — never leave the guardrails armed.
- **Recap:** tests written, green status (show the passing output).
- **Verify it isn't overfit (handed back — not done here):** green proves the locked tests pass, *not*
  that the implementation generalises — it may have hard-coded the test inputs. Tell the user to review
  the diff before trusting it, e.g. dispatch `code-reviewer` (or run the broader `feature-flow` review).
  If that review surfaces a real requirement gap, come back: add a test for it (Step 1, red) and let
  the loop close again.
- **Commit (propose, never automatic):** offer to commit the **tests first, then the code** via the
  project's `commit` skill. Do not run git directly.

## Loop engines (reference)

This skill defaults to the **`Stop` + `PreToolUse` hooks** above because they give hands-free
execution *and* a deterministic no-cheat guarantee on the test-lock. Two alternatives, if the context
calls for them:

- **`/goal "all tests pass"`** — session-only, no files to clean up; a separate evaluator re-checks
  after each turn. Lighter, but the no-cheat rule rests on model discipline, not a hard block.
- **`claude -p` in a shell loop** — fully scripted / out-of-session, each iteration in a *fresh*
  context (strongest anti-bias): `until <test-cmd>; do claude -p "Tests are red — fix the CODE, never
  the tests" --allowedTools "Edit,Bash(<test-cmd>)"; done`. Scope `--allowedTools` to exclude the test
  files.

## Not this skill

For **raising coverage on code that already exists** (write tests after the fact, never edit the
source) — use whatever after-the-fact testing/coverage skill the project provides, if any. This skill
is the opposite direction: tests first, then write the code.
